	<ol class="a">
		  <li> <b>It Boost Productivity</b></li></ol><br>
<p class="p">Studies have shown that that exercising releases more of the chemical compounds used in brain activity and cognition, thus improving your ability to focus and concentrate.
 Consistency is key.
</p><br>
<ol class="a" start="2">
		   <li><b>It Helps Manage Weight Loss</b></li></ol><br><p class="p">Exercise burns calories as you expend energy with each movement. Your metabolic rate also increases with physical activity and remains elevated even while at rest - meaning you continue to burn calories even when you’re not active.
			 </p>
			 <ol class="a" start="3">
		    <li><b>It Boost Your Mood, and Combats Depression</b></li></ol><br><p class="p">When you exercise, your brain releases chemicals such as endorphins, adrenaline, serotonin and dopamine, which all work together to positively affect your mood and improve anxiety levels.
</p>
<ol class="a" start="4">
			 <li> <b>It Helps Reduce Stress</b></li></ol><br><p class="p">Regular exercise tends to decrease the usual amount of cortisol in your bloodstream, leading to a reduction in symptoms of stress.
</p>
<ol class="a" start="5">
			  <li><b>It Improves Self Esteem</b></li></ol><br><p class="p">Creating an exercise plan and sticking to it allows you to enjoy a sense of achievement, alongside the sense of pride you’ll feel with your ever-improving physique.
</p>
<ol class="a" start="6">
			   <li><b>It Improves Sleep Patterns</b></li></ol><br><p class="p">Exercise works to strengthen circadian rhythms, promoting daytime alertness and helping to bring on sleepiness at night.
</p>
<ol class="a" start="7">
			    <li><b>It Fights Dementia</b></li></ol><br><p class="p">Exercise leads to an increased blood flow to the heart which in turn can cause an increase in blood flow to the brain, improving cognitive function.
</p>
<ol class="a" start="8">
<li> <b> It Improves Skin Tone and Clarity</b></li></ol><br><p class="p">By increasing blood flow, exercise helps nourish skin cells and keep them vital, whilst also helping to carry away waste products, including free radicals, from working cells.
</p>
<ol class="a" start="9">
<li> <b> It helps Reduce the Risk Of Major Illnesses</b></li></ol><br><p class="p">Regular exercise enhances the immune system and decreases the risk of developing conditions such as heart disease, strokes, diabetes and cancer by up to 50%.
</p>
<ol class="a" start="10">
<li> <b>It Lower Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Levels</b></li></ol><br><p class="p">Exercise reduces LDL cholesterol, the kind that clogs arteries. It also reduces your blood pressure, relieving stress on your heart.

</p>
<ol class="a" start="11">
<li> <b>It Strengthens Bones</b></li></ol><br><p class="p"> Exercise together with a healthy calcium intake, helps
 lower your odds of getting osteoporosis and other arthritic conditions as you grow older. The NHS 
 recommends doing at least five hours of weight-bearing exercise a week.
</p>
<ol class="a" start="12">
<li><b> It Improves Memory</b></li><br></ol><p class="p">In a study done at the University of British Columbia, 
researchers found that regular aerobic exercise boosts the size of the hippocampus, the brain area involved in verbal memory and learning.
</p>
<ol class="a" start="13">
<li> <b>It Plays a Role In Preventing Cancer</b>
</li><br></ol><p class="p">The Seattle Cancer Research Centre has found that at least 35% 
of all cancer deaths may be related to being overweight or due to a lack of activity.
 Exercise is believed to speed the passage of food through the colon, thereby reducing
 the amount of time that any toxins are in contact with the body. Overweight people also
 tend to have more insulin, which promotes the growth of tumours. For women, exercise
 reduces the level of oestrogen, a hormone linked to breast cancer.</p>
